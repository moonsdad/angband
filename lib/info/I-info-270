Reorganization of the flags for items.

Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Added floating point (yuck!) to "standard deviation" code.
Added extra "options", for "color", "disturb", and others
Implemented the "new_screen_layout" option (as an option).
Added a "Show depth in feet (vs actual level)" option.
Fixed more "gender" bugs in the monster recall code.
Wrote a true "output buffer" for I/O, no longer depends on Curses
Made it easy to add a "screen manager" for any "platform".

Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
