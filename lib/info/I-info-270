=== Basic "changes" from Angband 2.6.1 to Angband 2.7.0 ===


Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Added floating point (yuck!) to "standard deviation" code.
Added extra "options", for "color", "disturb", and others
Implemented the "new_screen_layout" option (as an option).
Added a "Show depth in feet (vs actual level)" option.
Fixed more "gender" bugs in the monster recall code.
Wrote a true "output buffer" for I/O, no longer depends on Curses
Made it easy to add a "screen manager" for any "platform".
Added "screen managers" for X11, Curses, and Macintosh
Made it easy to add a "recall window" to any "platform".
Incorporated the "color" code from MacAngband 2.6.1
Cleaned up the "screen layout update" code.
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Renamed a LOT of variables/fields to more "consistent" forms.
Fixed a few old bugs based in misplacement of certain flags.
Rewrote the "monster recall" code some more, genericized it some.
Reorganized the source to make the files more "self-contained".

Threw out the "Bill Cosby" message.  "Cute" is not "good".
Cleaned up the use of "hack_monptr" in a BIG way.
Separated "update_monsters()" from "process_monsters()".
Put "XXX" and "Hack" in the code to label areas of future work.
