=== Basic "changes" from Angband 2.6.1 to Angband 2.7.0 ===

Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Made it easy to add a "screen manager" for any "platform".
Added "screen managers" for X11, Curses, and Macintosh
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Renamed a LOT of variables/fields to more "consistent" forms.
Reorganized the source to make the files more "self-contained".

Put "XXX" and "Hack" in the code to label areas of future work.
