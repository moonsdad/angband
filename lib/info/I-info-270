Added floating point (yuck!) to "standard deviation" code.

Redid the targetting code, and the direction code.
Fixed more "gender" bugs in the monster recall code.
Wrote a true "output buffer" for I/O, no longer depends on Curses
Made it easy to add a "screen manager" for any "platform".
Added "screen managers" for X11, Curses, and Macintosh

Incorporated the "color" code from MacAngband 2.6.1
Cleaned up the "screen layout update" code.
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Added flags SUST_STR, SUST_INT, etc, to reduce "silliness".
Renamed a LOT of variables/fields to more "consistent" forms.
