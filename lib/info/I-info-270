=== Basic "changes" from Angband 2.6.1 to Angband 2.7.0 ===

Rewrite of the "pathname constructor" code.
Added extra "options", for "color", "disturb", and others
Wrote a true "output buffer" for I/O, no longer depends on Curses
Made it easy to add a "screen manager" for any "platform".
Added "screen managers" for X11, Curses, and Macintosh
Made it easy to add a "recall window" to any "platform".
Incorporated the "color" code from MacAngband 2.6.1
Cleaned up the "screen layout update" code.
Cleaned up the header files (a lot).
Separated out some generic "non-angband" files (like random.c).
Renamed a LOT of variables/fields to more "consistent" forms.
Fixed a few old bugs based in misplacement of certain flags.
Reorganized the source to make the files more "self-contained".

Put "XXX" and "Hack" in the code to label areas of future work.
