Angband 2.6.1 version 2 for the Macintosh.

This is version 2 of Angband 2.6.1 for the Macintosh.  It should run on
any 68000 with System 6.0.1? or higher OS.

It *SHOULD* be savefile-compatible with all other 2.6.1's on other platforms.
Remember to use BINARY when ftping!  This will also work with savefiles from
MacAngband 2.5.8.  (But 2.5.8 won't work with savefiles from 2.6.1!)

You can add fonts and sizes to the font and size menu using ResEdit.  Be sure the
fonts you add are fixed width fonts.  A list of fonts available on your system
can be obtained by looking at the Key Caps menu.

Please let me know if you encounter a bug, and try to describe it so that I can
reproduce it (mail me a binhex'd copy of your savefile if that will help).  Also,
any comments or suggestions you have will be greatly appreciated.

Send any comments, suggestions, and bugs to:

Known Bugs:

- Sometimes MacAngband can't find the lib directory- this is caused by an
   incompatibility with some INITs.  MacAngband will ask you to locate the
   lib directory manually if this occurs.  If this doesn't work, try putting
   the lib directory in your root directory.
